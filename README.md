## Problem Statement
Legal contracts are often written in complex, technical language that makes them difficult for non-lawyers to understand. Individuals and small businesses frequently sign agreements without fully grasping the implications of each clause—leading to unfavorable terms, hidden risks, and costly misunderstandings.

There is a lack of accessible tools that can:

* Break down contract language into simple, understandable summaries,
* Evaluate clauses for fairness and legal risk, and
* Allow users to engage interactively with their contracts to clarify concerns.

Traditional legal review is expensive, slow, and inaccessible to many. In a world where agreements are signed daily—leases, NDAs, partnerships, terms of service—there is an urgent need for an intelligent, user-friendly system that makes legal documents transparent and comprehensible.
